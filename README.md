ABSTRACT
Natural Disasters increasingly threaten communities worldwide, resulting in a crucial need for
rapid damage assessment and classification. This paper presents an efficient deep-learning approach using
Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) for classifying both disaster types and damage classification from
satellite imagery. Our model analyzes a dataset of approximately 26,000 satellite images across three
disaster types: wildfires, flooding, and post-disaster hurricane images. The CNN architecture employs two
convolution layers with 3x3 kernels, followed by MaxPooling and dense layers, achieving effective
classification despite the challenges that follow using satellite imagery resized to lower resolutions. The
results demonstrate the modelâ€™s capability to assist emergency management teams in rapid disaster
assessment, potentially improving response times and resource allocation during critical periods.
